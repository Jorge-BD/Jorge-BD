# 👋 Hi, I'm Jorge Baeza Díaz

I'm a tech enthusiast from Granada, Spain, currently embarking on my Computer Engineering journey at UGR.  
Passionate about technology since childhood—especially video games, understanding how things work behind the scenes, and building creative systems.

- 🎮 I love exploring the mechanics of games and software.
- 🛠️ I enjoy tinkering with code, Linux, and open-source projects.
- 🚀 Always curious, always learning.
